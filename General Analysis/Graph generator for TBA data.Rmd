This document is an analysis of the match result data available on thebluealliance.com for the 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition Game: Stronghold

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/stat/Documents/GitHub/2016Scouting-DefenseSetup-and-Crunching/General Analysis")

library(ggplot2)

auton <- read.csv('data through week 3-auto.csv', header = T, 
                     row.names = NULL, check.names = F)

tele <- read.csv('data through week 3-tele.csv', header = T, 
                     row.names = NULL, check.names = F)

defense <- read.csv('data through week 3-def.csv', header = T, 
                     row.names = NULL, check.names = F)
```

## Autonomous Mode

Let's start by taking a look at the autonomous data

```{r}
names(auton)
summary(auton)

by(auton$Crossing, auton$Week, summary)

qplot(x=Crossing, data=auton, binwidth=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Week)

qplot(x=Crossing, data=auton, binwidth=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Type)
```
